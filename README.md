# Mini Project: Tic-Tac-Toe Game
This project involves creating a simple yet engaging Tic-Tac-Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The classic 3x3 grid allows two players to take turns marking Xs and Os, aiming to line up three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal to win. If the grid is full without a winning line, the game ends in a draw.

# Features:
- User-friendly interface with responsive design.
- Real-time indication of the current player's turn.
- Automatic detection of win or draw conditions.
- Option to reset the game and play again.
- Simple JavaScript logic for grid management and win-checking.
